# dotfiles
My general settings / dotfiles

# Contents
colorschemes include submodules with a few color themes in them (vertex isn't needed in arch, it's installed through a script in Arch-Setup)

Settings includes my basic settings, and a script to symlink them

zsh includes my basic zsh setup, and a script to symlink them

# Install
Clone this repository with a name, using recursive, so that the submodules are pulled. e.g. ```git clone [url] $HOME/.dotfiles --recursive

# Warning
A couple of the scripts were originally written using $PWD, so run them from the directory they're sitting in.  I've been trying to remove them as I re-touch that part of the file.
