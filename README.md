# Linux-Settings
My general linux setup / shell scripts to setup

Arch contains install guide + scripts to install basic packages
colorschemes include submodules with a few color themes in them (vertex isn't needed in arch, it's installed through a script)
Settings includes my basic settings, and a symlink to link them
and zsh includes my basic zsh setup, and a script to link that

Clone this repository into something like ```.settings``` so it can sit there forever.
Warning: a couple scripts use ```$PWD```, so they break if they're called from a folder they're not in
